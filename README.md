### Retro
- What went well:
    - Using Angular Material was very rewarding 
    - I was happy with the setup of taking values of the select and the keyword and creating a query string based on that 

- What didn't go so well:
    - I ran into the duplicates issue and ended up just dropping my database as a guess and it ended up working.
    - I wanted to get the favorites from an API call but it didn't come together
    - I wanted the favorites icon to be shared as a service but didn't get the time to put that together how I wanted to
